# My first mod menu!

This is a little project to test out C# and BepInEx. 

For my modding experiment I selected this [game](https://github.com/Gvilor/3D_platformer) by [my friend](https://github.com/Gvilor).

This is my first mod or even my first C# project, so maybe there are a few mistakes.

# Functional
To open mod menu use F5

- Player
  - Speed
  - Jump Power
